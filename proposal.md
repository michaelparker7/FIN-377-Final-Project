# Research Proposal: Sports Betting Analysis
By Elvin Lee, Michael Parker, and Brandon Smeltz

## Research Question
Through this research, our goal is to determine whether or not there are teams in the NBA that consistently outperform the odds sports-betting platforms make. This project will be focused on the relationship between the different lines you can take as a better given that you take that line every game or for some subset of games that we find most profitable during our project, and how profitable you will become by doing this. For example, we can analyze each of the 30 teams in the NBA and look at the win percentage and winning amount for moneyline, spread, and total points.
